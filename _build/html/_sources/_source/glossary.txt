	Availability zone

		This enables you to arrange OpenStack compute hosts into logical groups and provides a form of physical isolation and redundancy from other availability zones, such as by using a separate power supply or network equipment.

	Egress
		Egress filtering is the practice of monitoring and potentially restricting the flow of information outbound from one network to another.

	Ephemeral storage

		It is associated with a single unique instance. Based on the instance, the size is defined. When the instance associated with it is terminated, data on ephemeral storage ceases to exist.
	
	Horizontal scaling

		Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources.

	Hypervisor
		A hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) is a piece of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor is running one or more virtual machines is defined as a host machine. Each virtual machine is called a guest machine.

	Ingress

		Ingress filtering is a technique used to ensure that incoming packets are actually from the networks from which they claim to originate.

	KVM
		Kernel-based VM (KVM) is an OpenStack-supported hypervisor. KVM is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V), ARM, IBM Power, and IBM zSeries. It consists of a loadable kernel module, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module.

	Libvert

		Libvert is an open source API, daemon and management tool for managing platform virtualization. It can be used to manage KVM, Xen, VMware ESX, QEMU and other virtualization technologies. These APIs are widely used in the orchestration layer of hypervisors in the development of a cloud-based solution.

	Multitenancy
		
		Multitenancy refers to an architecture in which multiple independent consumers (tenants) are serviced using a single set of resources. This lowers the cost of services for consumers. Virtualization enables resource pooling and Multitenancy in the cloud. For example, multiple virtual machines from different consumers can run simultaneously on the same physical server that runs the hypervisor.

	RabbitMQ

		RabbitMQ is an open source message broker software (sometimes called message-oriented Middleware) that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The RabbitMQ server is written in the Erlang programming language and is built on the Open Telecom Platform framework for clustering and failover. 
	
	Vertical scaling

		Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to your existing machine.

	Volume Storage

		This storage is not dependent on any perticular instance and is persistent. Volumes are user created and within Quota.
