Conventions
===========

The OpenStack documentation uses several typesetting conventions.

Notices
~~~~~~~

Notices take these forms:

.. note:: A comment with additional information that explains a part of the
          text.

.. important:: Something you must be aware of before proceeding.

.. tip:: An extra but helpful piece of practical advice.

.. caution:: Helpful information that prevents the user from making mistakes.

.. warning:: Critical information about the risk of data loss or security
             issues.

Command prompts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

   $ command

Any user, including the ``root`` user, can run commands that are
prefixed with the ``$`` prompt.

.. code-block:: console

   # command

The ``root`` user must run commands that are prefixed with the ``#``
prompt. You can also prefix these commands with the :command:`sudo`
command, if available, to run them.
