Edit the ``/etc/hosts`` file to contain the following:

.. code-block:: ini

   # controller
   10.0.0.11       controller

   # compute1
   10.0.0.31       compute1

   # block1
   10.0.0.41       block1

   # object1
   10.0.0.51       object1

   # object2
   10.0.0.52       object2

.. warning::

   Some distributions add an extraneous entry in the ``/etc/hosts``
   file that resolves the actual hostname to another loopback IP
   address such as ``127.0.1.1``. You must comment out or remove this
   entry to prevent name resolution problems. **Do not remove the
   127.0.0.1 entry.**

.. note::

   To reduce complexity of this guide, we add host entries for optional
   services regardless of whether you choose to deploy them.
