Switch to console mode in Linux
===============================

The usual method of command-line access in Linux/Ubuntu is to start a terminal, however sometimes it is useful to switch to the real console:

Use the Ctrl-Alt-F1 shortcut keys to switch to the first console.

To switch back to Desktop mode, use theCtrl-Alt-F7 shortcut keys.


.. Note:: There are six consoles available. Each one is accessible with the shortcut keys Ctrl-Alt-F1 to Ctrl-Alt-F6.
